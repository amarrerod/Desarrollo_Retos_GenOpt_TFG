\begin{block}{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item High amount of parameters increases the complexity to evaluate the performance of the algorithms.
	\item The task of assessing a new modification was really difficult.
	\item CMA-ES algorithm accomplished the \textbf{third place} in the final leaderboard of the GenOpt contest considering the High Jump criterion.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Improve the different tested algorithms.
